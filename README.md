# Inflation

This application proposes an inflation tracker across several OECD countries. The data are from the [OECD (2021), \"Main Economic Indicators - complete database\"](https://doi.org/10.1787/data-00052-en).

The application is hosted on https://www.shinyapps.io/ and can be accessed from this [link](https://venance-riblier.shinyapps.io/Inflation/).
