# Inflation

This application proposes an inflation tracker across several OECD countries. The data are from the [OECD, \"Main Economic Indicators - complete database\"](https://doi.org/10.1787/data-00052-en) and are updated based on the [OECD API](https://data.oecd.org/api/).

The application is hosted on https://www.shinyapps.io/ and can be accessed from this [link](https://venance-riblier.shinyapps.io/Inflation/). It also can be launched directly from **R**, by using the command ``shiny::runGitHub("Inflation", "venance-riblier", ref = "main")``.
